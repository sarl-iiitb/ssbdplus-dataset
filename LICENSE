The SSBDPlus dataset is a collection of URLs of children videos exhibiting
self-stimulatory ("stimming") behaviours commonly used in autism
diagnosis.
These videos, posted by parents/caregivers on public domain websites,
have been annotated for the stimming behaviours.
The videos themselves are not distributed as part of the SSBD dataset but
can be found via the URLs listed in the support documentation.
All users must respect the Terms of Service of the public domain websites
that the URLs point to, such as:
